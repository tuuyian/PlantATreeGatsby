This is a Gatsby Project to create static React websites that can be hosted on any hosting plaform. 

Initially it has been a single page site consisting of a view of a database created through Appbase.io which can then be filtered through using ReactiveSearch which is a React and React Native UI components library for Elasticsearch. Finally to purchase the products that are chosen from the database we use Snipcart which is a eCommerce API which allows for the use of a cart with card transactions so on and so forth.
